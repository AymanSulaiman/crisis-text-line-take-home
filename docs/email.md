# From the email

Dear Ayman,

I hope this email finds you well. We are impressed by your background and experience, and we believe you could be a valuable addition to our team. As part of our hiring process, we would like to invite you to participate in a technical assessment tailored to showcase your skills and expertise in data engineering practices.

We offer three options for completing the assessment:

Take Home: Complete the attached technical assignment at your pace and let us know when you are complete.
Similar Project: Bring an existing project that is similar to our technical assignment for us to discuss with you in the interview.
Live coding: If you are comfortable we can work together in the interview to complete the assignment. 
Technical Assessment (See Attachment - Senior Data Engineer Coding Challenge)

The assessment involves implementing the Medallion Architecture to process and transform the MH-CLD-2021-DS0001 SAMHSA dataset using PySpark. This exercise will allow you to demonstrate your expertise in data engineering practices and showcase your ability to ensure the robustness and scalability of data pipelines.

Here's a brief overview of the assessment tasks:

Reading the Dataset: Use PySpark to read the dataset, explore its schema and data types, and implement schema checks.
Implementing the Medallion Architecture: Create bronze, silver, and gold tables for staging, transformation, and business layers respectively, and perform necessary data validations and transformations.
Writing SQL Queries: Write SQL queries to retrieve data from the created tables.
Transformation Exercise: Complete additional tasks related to data type conversion, normalization, standardization, and data partitioning and sampling.
Documentation and Presentation: Document the entire process, including data sources, transformations, and the rationale behind the Medallion Architecture implementation.
To access the dataset and detailed instructions for the assessment, please see attachment - Senior Data Engineer Coding Challenge. You are required to submit your solution via GitHub before your scheduled interview.

We anticipate that the take home option should not take more than 24 hours to complete. 

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the assessment, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout the process.

We look forward to reviewing your submission and hopefully welcoming you to our team at Crisis Text Line.

Best regards,

Andrew
