# Notes

## TODO's

snappy compression.

Discuss the missing columns with Andrew.

Transform the data in a crude way and find ways of validating the data.

Do parts 3 and 4.

Clean everything up in the exploration notebook.

Build out a docker contianer and yaml.

Build this out in Azure Databricks because they give you $200 in credits. Integrate with GitHub and give anyone access.

## Ideas

validation ideas:

- Schema
- proportions of data from codebook

Build out the `main.py` file that will house everything. Do it functionally.

Build out other files that will house the validations and the medallion architecture.

Talk about how the tech is fitting in, cluster config

Databricks file storage for now, blob storage if it get chonky

Suggest Mage.AI as an alternative for cron jobs.
